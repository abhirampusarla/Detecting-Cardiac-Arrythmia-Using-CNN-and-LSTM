# Detecting-Cardiac-Arrythmia-Using-CNN-and-LSTM
This project uses CNN and LSTM models to classify cardiac arrhythmias from ECG signals. CNN extracts spatial features, while LSTM captures temporal patterns for improved accuracy. The system aims to support early diagnosis and enhance clinical decision-making through automated ECG analysis.
